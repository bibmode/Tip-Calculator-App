## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I did this challenge for the mere reason of refreshing my javascript skill with a simple project. I learned how to make better data validation and utilize utility classes to add changes in the UI instead of individually changing the css properties directly in javascript which indeed helped in making the development of this app faster.

### Continued development

I used desktop first approach for this one and I wished I opted with a mobile-first approach which would have made things easier especially with dealing with grid containers.
